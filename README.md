### Project Title
Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

### Description

A company builds only apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

This project is about analyzing data by using 'list of list' structure not data frames.
